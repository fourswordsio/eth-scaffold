## Introduction

The staking works on the logic of Weighted average depending on the price of the public good project governance token hence this repositiory assumes that the projects users can stake in have a token and it is a [retroactive erc20 token](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-examples/tree/erc20-retroactive-funding), there can be other factors to determine weightage but probably the price was the most logical one.
